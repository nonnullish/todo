## todo
### you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
##### (which in this case means creating a todo app)

not really. But! this todo app is a *webpage* and it uses your browser's *local storage* to store all the virtual sticky notes so that you can
- set the [link](https://nonnullish.github.io/todo/) as your homepage so that you can see the list whenever you open a new tab
- even better - download the files and set the local path as your homepage so that you can see the list whenever you open a new tab *even without an internet connection*
- style it however you want with an extension like [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)
- sync it between devices with an extension like [LocalStorage Sync](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/localstorage-sync/nlgkphpdbpmpdngngdafeggajlblhhko) (haven't tried but should work i guess?)
