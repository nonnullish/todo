not really. But! this todo app is a *webpage* and it uses your browser's *local storage* to store all the virtual sticky notes so that you can
- set the [link](https://tusindfryd.github.io/todo/) as your homepage so that you can see the list whenever you open a new tab
- even better - download the files and set the local path as your homepage so that you can see the list whenever you open a new tab *even without an internet connection*
- style it however you want with an extension like [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)
- sync it between devices with an extension like [LocalStorage Sync](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/localstorage-sync/nlgkphpdbpmpdngngdafeggajlblhhko) (haven't tried but should work i guess?)

enjoy!

##### 11th March 2023 - update
my initial idea was that this app was supposed to be as bare-bones as possible, and a hypothetical user would write their own style for it. but i've been using it for over two years now, and over this time i have added some cool stuff for myself, and then i thought i would actually try to polish it a little bit and make the changes public. so, available now:
- animations 
- battery status - with the icon updating according to the battery state
- new background every day - from the Art Institute of Chicago, the MET gallery, NASA (APOD), or Unsplash. also possible to set a custom path / url or a solid color
